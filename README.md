I'm still learning Python and using these as reference guides for any employment opportunities and future projects.

I used Qt Designer to make the layout.

This is a simple tool that reads and writes XML files.

Click on run.bat to run the program, the bat file will install pyside6 and qdarkstyle if they are not already installed on your system and start the application.

Best Regards,<br/>
